# ☕ Coffee Quality Analysis (Power BI Dashboard)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes **Arabica coffee quality** using sensory evaluation data from 200+ samples.  
The report explores how **sensory attributes, processing methods, altitude, origin regions, and defects** influence the overall **Total Cup Points (TCP)** – the global measure of coffee quality.

## 🔑 Key Insights
1. **Altitude Effect** – Higher altitude coffees score better (Very High: ~84.7 vs Low: ~83.4).  
2. **Variety Impact** – Castillo (89.33),Red Bourbon (87.08), SL34+Gesha (86.75), lead in quality.  
4. **Processing Methods** – Double Anaerobic (89) and Honey/Mossto (87) outperform traditional Washed/Natural (~83–84).  
5. **Origin & Region** – Colombian regions (*Piendamo Cauca: 89*) and Ethiopia consistently deliver top scores.  
6. **Sensory Drivers** – Aroma, Flavor, Acidity, and Body are most correlated with TCP.  
7. **Defects Impact** –  
   - Category One defects → sharp quality loss.  
   - Category Two defects → gradual erosion.  
   - Quakers >5 → drop of ~3–5 points, often below specialty threshold.  
   - Higher moisture % → more defects.  

## 📊 Dashboards
- **Sensory Drivers** – Attribute-wise contribution to TCP.  
- **Processing & Variety** – Quality differences by method and genetic variety.  
- **Altitude & Region** – Environmental influence on scores.  
- **Defects Analysis** – Impact of Cat.1, Cat.2, Quakers, and Moisture %.  

## ⚙️ Tools & Technologies
- **Power BI** – Dashboard design & visualization.  
- **Power Query Editior** - Cleaning , Transforming, Manipulating data
- **Dataset** – Arabica Coffee Quality data (CQI).
